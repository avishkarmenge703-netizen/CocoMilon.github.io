## The Story Behind This Cartoon

This cartoon was inspired by my own Monday morning routine. I swear, there's some sort of time dilation that happens between Sunday night and Monday morning. The weekend flies by at light speed, but Monday morning? That's a different story.

I was sitting at my desk, staring at my inbox, and I could literally feel myself moving slower. My brain was buffering, and my body felt like it was trying to move through molasses. That's when the image of slowly morphing into a sloth came to mind!

## Why This Resonates

We've all been there:
- Hitting snooze three (or seven) times
- Forgetting where you put your keys/wallet/phone/brain
- Staring at the coffee maker, willing it to brew faster
- Opening your email and immediately wanting to close it again

It's comforting to know we're not alone in this Monday morning struggle. Sometimes, the best way to deal with it is to laugh about it!

## Behind the Scenes

**Tools used:** 
- Procreate on iPad Pro
- Custom "Monday Morning Blues" color palette
- Reference: Actual me on Monday morning (no sloths were harmed)

**Time to create:** About 3 hours from sketch to final

**Fun fact:** The coffee cup in the cartoon is the same one I use every day!
